No coding on my part, all the credit for actual code belongs to others including https://gist.github.com/albertbori/1798d88a93175b9da00b

Assuming you have git all ready configured for GitHub, then simply do the following

```bash
git clone git@github.com:paulbhart/toggleairport.git
cd toggleairport
sudo ./install.sh
